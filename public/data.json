Sometimes, we recognize stress immediately, but other times, it goes unnoticed as we push through our day. Here are some common signs and symptoms of stress:</p><ul style='list-style-type:decimal;list-style-position:inside;margin-top:10px;'><li>Difficulty breathing</li><li>Panic attacks</li><li>Blurred vision or sore eyes</li><li>Sleep problems</li><li>Fatigue</li><li>Muscle aches and headaches</li><li>Chest pains and high blood pressure</li><li>Indigestion or heartburn</li><li>Constipation or diarrhea</li><li>Feeling sick, dizzy, or faint</li><li>Sudden weight gain or weight loss</li><li>Rashes or itchy skin</li><li>Sweating</li><li>Changes in your menstrual cycle</li></ul><h2 style='font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>How Stress Can Make You Feel</h2><ul style='list-style-type:decimal;list-style-position:inside;margin-top:10px;'><li>Irritable, angry, or impatient</li><li>Overwhelmed or overburdened</li><li>Anxious, nervous, or afraid</li><li>Racing thoughts and inability to switch off</li><li>Unable to enjoy yourself</li><li>Depressed or uninterested in life</li><li>Loss of sense of humor</li><li>A sense of dread or worry</li><li>Neglected or lonely</li></ul><h style='font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>How Stress Can Affect Your Behavior</h><ul style='list-style-type:decimal;list-style-position:inside;margin-top:10px;'><li>Difficulty making decisions</li><li>Difficulty concentrating or remembering things</li><li>Snapping at people</li><li>Nail biting</li><li>Picking at or itching your skin</li><li>Grinding your teeth or clenching your jaw</li><li>Sexual problems, such as loss of interest in sex</li><li>Eating too much or too little</li><li>Increased use of alcohol, drugs, or smoking</li> <li>Restlessness or an inability to sit still</li><li>Crying or feeling tearful</li><li>Excessive spending or shopping</li><li>Changes in exercise habits, either too much or too little</li><li>Withdrawing from social interactions</li></ul><h1 style='font-size:16px;font-weight:bold;margin-top:10px;'>Does Yoga Help Reduce Stress?</h1><p style='margin-top:10px;'>Yoga promotes both mental and physical relaxation, helping to reduce stress and anxiety. The physical postures enhance flexibility, relieve tension, and alleviate pain, while helping to release physical blockages like muscle knots and trapped emotions. These postures also promote the release of endorphins, the 'feel-good' hormones that positively influence how you handle stress.</p><p style='margin-top:10px;'>Practicing yoga encourages focus on the present moment, enhancing awareness, concentration, and mental clarity. As you become more aware of the temporary nature of your bodily sensations, thoughts, and feelings, you may find it easier to let go of attachments to them, fostering feelings of love, joy, and serenity.</p><p style='margin-top:10px;'>Breathing exercises, known as pranayama, teach you to relax, regulate your breath, and breathe deeply. These techniques help reduce stress, calm your body and mind, improve sleep quality, and promote mindfulness.</p>",
